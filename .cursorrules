# BlueTech Education Project Coding Standards

As an AI coding assistant, you must adhere to the following rules for all interactions in this project.

## 1. Strict i18n & Translation Standards
- **No Raw Keys:** Never display dotted translation keys (e.g., `admin.course.title`) in the UI. Always use the `t()` function.
- **JSON-First Workflow:** Before adding a new key to the code, you MUST update both `public/locales/he/common.json` and `public/locales/en/common.json`.
- **Real Content Only:** Use professional, real-world Hebrew and English content. No "Test 1" or placeholders.
- **Language Awareness:** Ensure components handle language switching gracefully (RTL/LTR).

## 2. UI & Layout (RTL/LTR Support)
- **Directional Styling:** Use Tailwind logical properties instead of fixed left/right:
  - Use `ps-*` and `pe-*` (padding start/end)
  - Use `ms-*` and `me-*` (margin start/end)
  - Use `start-*` and `end-*` (positioning)
  - Use `text-start` and `text-end`
  - Use `rounded-s-*` and `rounded-e-*`
- **Font Handling:** 
  - Hebrew: Heebo, Assistant
  - English: Inter, Montserrat
- **Layout:** Ensure all UI layouts are fully responsive and mirror correctly when switching between RTL and LTR.

## 3. Modular & Data-Driven Architecture
- **Course Logic:** Always check course flags (`has_pre_test`, `is_paid`, `has_ai_mentor`) before rendering features.
- **Visibility Logic:** Always filter content/courses based on the `visibility` array (e.g., `['he', 'en']`) and the current active UI language.
- **Admin Protection:** All admin routes and components must include a role check (`role === 'admin'`).

## 4. Supabase & Database Management
- **MCP First:** Before suggesting schema changes, use the Supabase MCP to inspect existing tables and policies.
- **Migrations:** Always propose a migration plan before executing changes.
- **Type Safety:** Always use and update generated TypeScript types from the database (`src/types/database.types.ts`).

## 5. Component Standards
- **Tech Stack:** Functional React components, Tailwind CSS, and `lucide-react` for icons.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep logic separated into hooks or services where possible.
- **Readability:** Maintain clean, well-commented code that follows existing project patterns.
